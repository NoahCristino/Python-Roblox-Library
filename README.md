# robloxlib
A python library for ROBLOX!
# Prerequisites
Before using the library you need to install the requests library, BeautifulSoup4 library, and the lxml library.
If you have pip then do: `pip install requests`
`pip install bs4`
and..
`pip install lxml`

(If you are using the 5.x versions, you need datefinder.. `pip install datefinder`)

If not then do:

`sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential`

`sudo pip install --upgrade pip`

`sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv`
# How to install

If you want to install using `python setup.py install` (experimental) then look in the testing folder.

# Examples
Check the [examples](https://github.com/NoahCristino/robloxlib/tree/master/examples) directory for examples.
# Documentation
Documentation has been moved to the [docs](https://github.com/NoahCristino/robloxlib/blob/master/docs/documentation.md) folder.
# Builds
The `builds` directory contains all the old versions that aren't up to date, but they are still somewhat stable. They only exist for history! So I recommened you don't go you don't touch them.
