# How to install
Place the `robloxlib.py` file located here: https://github.com/NoahCristino/robloxlib/blob/master/testing/robloxlib/robloxlib.py in your python directory ex. C:\Python27.

Check the examples directory for examples
# Documentation
Documentation has been moved to the `docs` folder: https://github.com/NoahCristino/robloxlib/blob/master/docs/documentation.md
# Builds
The `builds` directory contains all the old versions that aren't up to date, but they are still somewhat stable. They only exist for history! So I recommened you don't go you don't touch them.
