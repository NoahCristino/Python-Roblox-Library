# robloxlib
A python library for ROBLOX!
# Prerequisites
Before using the library you need to install the requests library, BeautifulSoup4 library, and the lxml library.
If you have pip then do: `pip install requests`
`pip install bs4`
and..
`pip install lxml`

(If you are using version 5.0+, you need datefinder.. `pip install datefinder`)

If not then do:

`sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential`

`sudo pip install --upgrade pip`

`sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv`
# How to install
Goto the [builds](https://github.com/NoahCristino/robloxlib/tree/master/builds) directory to see all the stable releases. I recommend using the latest one. Download the `robloxlib.py` file. If you want the bleeding edge version, (not recommended since it will probably be buggy, but might contain some new features, before they are offically released), then download [robloxlib.py](https://github.com/NoahCristino/robloxlib/blob/master/testing/robloxlib/robloxlib.py) in the `testing` folder. 

Now that you have `robloxlib.py`, just copy it to your python directory ex. C:\Python27, and you're all set!

If you want to install using `python setup.py install` (experimental) then look in the testing folder. **Note:** `setup.py` only works for installing the bleeding edge version. It's not supported for the offical builds yet.
